            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent biochemical insight! While cells are incredibly complex, they likely evolved from much simpler self-replicating systems. The RNA World hypothesis shows how chemistry can bootstrap itself into biology through natural selection acting on molecular replicators.",

            correct_feedback: "Nuanced understanding! Miller-Urey showed organic compounds can form naturally, but didn't create life itself or solve all abiogenesis puzzles. The transition from organic chemistry to self-replicating biology remains mysterious and might involve processes beyond simple atmospheric chemistry.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Brilliant biological reasoning! The universal genetic code strongly suggests common ancestry from a single origin. Whether this reflects design or represents the 'frozen accident' of one successful molecular system outcompeting alternatives remains profoundly mysterious.",
            incorrect_feedback: "The genetic code's universality does suggest single origin, but this might reflect common ancestry rather than design. One successful coding system might have dominated early Earth, eliminating alternatives through competition.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Insightful analogy! While DNA stores information like code, it evolved through natural processes that can create complex information systems. Evolution acts as a blind programmer, writing genetic software through mutation and selection over millions of years.",
            incorrect_feedback: "DNA's information complexity is remarkable, but information can arise through evolutionary processes. Natural selection acts like a filter, preserving useful genetic 'programs' while discarding harmful ones, creating functional complexity over time.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent molecular insight! RNA can both store information like DNA and catalyze reactions like proteins. This dual capability suggests early life might have used RNA for both genetics and metabolism, gradually evolving the DNA-protein partnership we see today.",
            incorrect_feedback: "The RNA World is a compelling hypothesis, but significant challenges remain. How did self-replicating RNA molecules first arise? The transition from RNA to DNA-protein systems also involves considerable complexity.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Brilliant stereochemical observation! Biological homochirality is puzzling, but might result from symmetry-breaking events in early chemistry. Once one molecular 'handedness' gained advantage, it could have dominated through catalytic feedback, creating the uniform chirality we observe.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Molecular handedness is indeed mysterious, but asymmetric catalysis and amplification processes can create chiral dominance from initially random mixtures. Chemistry can break its own symmetry through non-linear feedback processes.",

            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent biological insight! Extremophiles demonstrate life's remarkable adaptability - thriving in boiling acid, intense radiation, extreme pressure. These adaptations show how natural selection can craft solutions to seemingly impossible environmental challenges.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While extremophiles show impressive adaptation, their existence doesn't fully explain how life originated. They might represent highly evolved descendants of simpler organisms rather than examples of easy life emergence.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Insightful systems thinking! While current metabolic networks are highly integrated, they likely evolved through gradual addition and modification of simpler pathways. Biochemical systems can evolve complexity by duplicating existing pathways and modifying the copies.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Metabolic complexity is remarkable, but 'irreducible' complexity can evolve through pathway duplication, modification, and integration. What seems irreducible might be the result of evolution eliminating redundant backup systems over time.",

            correct_answer: true,
            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Interesting astrobiological perspective! Panspermia is scientifically plausible - microorganisms can survive space travel, and organic compounds exist throughout the cosmos. However, this pushes life's origin to another location rather than explaining how life began initially.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While panspermia is possible, it merely relocates the origin question rather than solving it. If life came from space, how did it begin there? The fundamental mystery of abiogenesis remains unsolved.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Profound cosmic insight! The narrow ranges of fundamental constants that allow stable atoms, molecules, and chemistry are remarkable. Whether through design or anthropic selection in a multiverse, our universe seems exquisitely calibrated for complexity and life.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Physical fine-tuning is striking, but might reflect anthropic selection - we observe a life-friendly universe because we exist to observe it. In countless universes with different constants, only life-friendly ones develop observers.",

            correct_feedback: "Excellent chemical insight! Self-organizing systems like crystallization, chemical oscillations, and autocatalytic networks show how order can emerge from disorder through natural processes. These systems might represent stepping stones toward biological organization.",

            correct_answer: true,
            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Brilliant temporal insight! Life appeared within roughly 500-700 million years after Earth became habitable - remarkably quick on cosmic timescales. This suggests either life emerges easily under suitable conditions, or our planet was particularly well-suited for abiogenesis.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Life's rapid emergence might be misleading - we only see the successful outcome. The apparent speed might reflect survivor bias rather than indicating that life genesis is easy or inevitable.",

            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent evolutionary insight! Natural selection is indeed 'wasteful' - most species go extinct, most mutations are harmful, most evolutionary experiments fail. This trial-and-error process seems more consistent with natural exploration than efficient design.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While evolution appears wasteful, this might be the most effective way to explore biological possibility space. Massive parallel experimentation, though inefficient locally, might be optimal globally for discovering innovative solutions.",

            correct_feedback: "Insightful biochemical reasoning! Photosynthesis is indeed sophisticated, but likely evolved gradually from simpler light-harvesting systems. Early photosynthetic bacteria used simpler pathways that evolved into the complex oxygen-producing systems we see today.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent geochemical insight! Phosphorus is indeed scarce and often locked in insoluble minerals. Recent research suggests meteorite impacts, lightning, or specific geological processes might have provided the soluble phosphorus needed for early biochemistry.",

While protein folding is incredibly complex, the amino acid sequence does contain the folding information - it's just that we don't fully understand the folding code yet. Molecular chaperones help, but the sequence determines the final structure.",
