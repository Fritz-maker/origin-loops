            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Profound insight into identity's mystery! Personal continuity despite total cellular replacement over seven years does suggest identity transcends material substance. Whether through designed soul or emergent patterns, the self seems to be about organization rather than matter.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Identity persistence through material change is striking. While pattern continuity might explain this, the remarkable stability of self-experience despite constant physical flux suggests deeper organizing principles.",

            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent neuroscientific understanding! The self does appear to be actively constructed by brain processes - integrating memories, current sensations, and social information into a coherent narrative identity. Brain damage can alter or fragment this construction.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While the brain clearly constructs aspects of self-experience, the deeper question remains: what is the 'I' that experiences this constructed self? The constructor might be more fundamental than the construction.",

            value: 20,
            correct_feedback: "Profound philosophical insight! If free will is real, it does seem to require that conscious choice transcends deterministic brain processes. This suggests the deciding self operates by principles beyond pure materialism, whether through designed agency or emergent causation.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Free will does pose challenges to pure materialism. If choices are genuinely free rather than determined by prior physical states, this suggests non-physical aspects of selfhood or new forms of causation.",

Twin studies and longitudinal research support the view that individual differences emerge through natural developmental processes.",

Human moral reasoning does seem to transcend survival needs - we can choose principles over personal advantage, sacrifice for strangers, and pursue abstract justice. This suggests personal development serves cosmic rather than merely biological purposes.",

            correct_feedback: "Excellent attachment theory insight! Early relationship patterns do shape personality development throughout life. Secure, anxious, or avoidant attachment styles formed in childhood influence adult relationships, supporting social rather than designed explanations of personality.",

The universal human search for meaning and purpose does suggest individual existence serves cosmic functions beyond biological survival. Each person seems designed to contribute unique perspectives to reality's self-understanding.",

People can indeed change personality, habits, and perspectives through experience and deliberate effort, showing selfhood as ongoing process.",

            value: 20,
            correct_feedback: "Profound metaphysical insight! The absolute privacy of personal experience is unique in physical reality. This irreducible subjectivity suggests individual consciousness operates by principles beyond ordinary physical causation, pointing to special metaphysical status.",

Digital platforms provide new tools for identity construction, but the constructing self remains more fundamental than its constructions.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Social media does show how external feedback influences identity, but this might demonstrate the self's inherent social nature rather than proving it's entirely constructed by others. The self that responds to feedback remains prior to the feedback.",
