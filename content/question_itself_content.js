            correct_answer: true,
            value: 20,
            correct_feedback: "Profound meta-cognitive insight! The match between our questioning minds and reality's comprehensible structure does suggest designed correspondence. Why should reality be mathematical and minds capable of understanding mathematics unless both were designed for mutual comprehension?",
            incorrect_feedback: "The fit between questioning minds and comprehensible reality is striking. Whether through design or evolution, consciousness and cosmos seem matched for mutual understanding in ways that pure chance seems unlikely to produce.",

            correct_answer: true,
            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent evolutionary insight! Curiosity and exploration do provide survival advantages by helping organisms discover resources, avoid dangers, and adapt to changing conditions. Questioning might be sophisticated extension of basic exploratory behavior.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While exploration provides survival benefits, human questioning often exceeds survival needs - asking about meaning, purpose, existence itself. The questioning drive seems to transcend its evolutionary origins.",

            correct_answer: true,
            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Brilliant epistemological insight! Questions do require conceptual frameworks - you can't ask about what you have no concept of whatsoever. This suggests questioning operates within designed cognitive structures that organize knowledge and enable inquiry.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Questions requiring conceptual frameworks is true, but these frameworks might emerge through learning and experience rather than being pre-designed. Cognitive structures could develop rather than being innate.",

            correct_answer: true,
            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent developmental insight! Children do ask hundreds of questions per day while adults ask far fewer. Young brains are indeed configured for rapid learning, with intense curiosity serving developmental rather than merely survival functions.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While children's questioning serves learning, the dramatic decrease in adult questioning might reflect social conditioning rather than natural development. Perhaps we're trained out of our natural curiosity rather than naturally outgrowing it.",

            value: 20,
            correct_feedback: "Profound cross-cultural insight! All cultures do grapple with questions about existence, meaning, morality, and purpose despite vast differences. This universality suggests these questions reflect fundamental features of reality that consciousness naturally recognizes.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Philosophical universals are striking, but might reflect shared human psychology rather than objective reality features. Universal cognitive structures could generate similar questions without those questions necessarily reflecting reality's nature.",

            correct_feedback: "Excellent scientific methodology insight! Scientific questioning does follow natural patterns - observation, hypothesis, prediction, testing - that seem to emerge from how minds naturally approach problems rather than designed procedures.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While scientific method seems natural, its effectiveness at revealing truth might suggest designed correspondence between minds and reality. Why should natural thinking patterns be so effective at discovering universal laws?",

            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent developmental linguistics! Question formation does emerge naturally as language develops. Children naturally discover interrogative forms through interaction, suggesting questioning abilities arise from general linguistic and social capacities.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Profound insight into questioning's deeper purposes! Many deep questions - Why does anything exist? What is consciousness? - seem unanswerable yet universally compelling. This suggests questioning serves spiritual or aesthetic purposes beyond information gathering.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Unanswerable questions are indeed intriguing. While they might seem purposeless from information perspective, they could serve functions like expanding imagination, promoting humility, or maintaining intellectual curiosity.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Important distinction! AI can generate question-like text, but whether it experiences genuine curiosity or uncertainty remains unclear. True questioning might require subjective experience of not-knowing, which is different from computational question generation.",
            incorrect_feedback: "AI question generation is sophisticated but might be mimicking rather than experiencing questioning. Genuine curiosity involves subjective states - wonder, uncertainty, desire to know - that might be uniquely conscious.",

            value: 20,
            correct_feedback: "Ultimate meta-cognitive insight! The infinite regress of questioning - questions about questioning itself - does suggest inquiry is built into consciousness's fundamental structure rather than being learned behavior. Recursion as basic feature of aware.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Recursive questioning is remarkable and might indicate deep structural features of consciousness. The ability to turn inquiry upon itself suggests questioning as fundamental rather than superficial aspect of awareness.",
