            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Profound philosophical insight! The hard problem identifies the explanatory gap between physical processes and subjective experience. Why should neural activity feel like anything from the inside? This mystery suggests consciousness might be fundamental rather than emergent.",
            incorrect_feedback: "The hard problem remains unsolved despite advances in neuroscience. We can map neural correlates of consciousness but explaining why these processes generate subjective experience - rather than operating in the dark - remains deeply mysterious.",

            correct_answer: false,
            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Insightful but incomplete! While consciousness might provide advantages, unconscious information processing could theoretically achieve the same results more efficiently. The puzzle is why evolution chose subjective experience over sophisticated unconscious computation.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Consider this mystery: Advanced unconscious processing could handle planning and coordination without subjective experience. Why did evolution add the 'inner light' of consciousness when unconscious systems might work just as well?",
            engine_commentary: "The Engine observes: If consciousness provides survival advantages, why didn't evolution create philosophical zombies instead - beings that act conscious but feel nothing inside? What is consciousness adding to the survival equation?"

            correct_answer: true,
            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Brilliant observation! The binding problem asks how distributed neural processes create unified experience. While various theories exist, the emergence of singular awareness from multiple brain systems remains mysterious and might require explanatory principles beyond current neuroscience.",
            incorrect_feedback: "The binding problem is indeed puzzling. How do separate neural processes for vision, hearing, memory, and emotion combine into one coherent conscious experience? Current neuroscience hasn't fully explained this unity.",

            correct_answer: true,
            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent neuroscientific understanding! Global workspace theory suggests consciousness arises when information becomes globally accessible across brain networks. This provides a framework for understanding awareness in terms of information integration and availability.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While global workspace theory is promising, it explains the functions of consciousness better than the phenomenon itself. Why should global information availability feel like anything from the inside?",
            engine_commentary: "The Engine notes: Information becoming globally available in the brain... but why should information integration create inner experience rather than just better information processing?"

            correct_answer: false,
            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Thoughtful but cautious analysis needed! While near-death experiences are profound, they likely occur during periods of altered but ongoing brain activity. These experiences might reveal consciousness's flexibility rather than its independence from neural processes.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Near-death experiences are fascinating but don't clearly demonstrate consciousness independent of brain activity. These states might involve altered neural processing rather than consciousness existing outside the brain.",

            correct_answer: true,
            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent evolutionary perspective! Consciousness likely evolved gradually - from basic sensitivity to stimuli, through increasingly sophisticated information processing, to full self-reflective awareness. This gradual emergence supports naturalistic explanations.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While consciousness likely evolved gradually, the key transitions remain mysterious. When did information processing become subjective experience? The gradualism applies to behavior more clearly than to inner experience.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Insightful but consider alternatives! Brain architecture reflects millions of years of evolutionary refinement. What appears designed might result from natural selection optimizing neural networks for survival and reproduction over countless generations.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Brain complexity is remarkable, but evolution can produce sophisticated architecture through incremental improvements. Neural networks optimize through evolutionary processes without requiring external design.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Crucial distinction! Current AI exhibits sophisticated behaviors but shows no clear evidence of subjective experience. Consciousness involves inner experience, not just external behavior. The difference between acting conscious and being conscious remains profound.",
            incorrect_feedback: "AI can simulate conscious-like behaviors, but whether it experiences anything subjectively remains unclear. Consciousness involves inner experience that might be fundamentally different from computational processing.",

            value: 20,
            correct_feedback: "Profound existential insight! The sheer existence of subjective experience is remarkable. If unconscious information processing could handle survival, why does consciousness exist? Its presence might serve purposes beyond biological function.",
            incorrect_feedback: "This raises deep questions about consciousness's ultimate purpose. Pure survival could theoretically be achieved unconsciously, so consciousness's existence might indicate larger cosmic significance.",

            correct_answer: false,
            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent analogy but crucial difference! Wetness is how H2O appears to us, but consciousness is how the brain appears to itself. Consciousness is the system's inner experience, not its external appearance to observers.",
            incorrect_feedback: "The wetness analogy misses consciousness's unique feature - subjectivity. Wetness is how we observe H2O, but consciousness is the brain's self-experience, which is categorically different from external observation.",
            engine_commentary: "The Engine notes: Wetness has no inner experience of being wet... but consciousness is precisely the inner experience of being conscious. The analogy breaks down at the most crucial point..."

            value: 20,
            correct_feedback: "Fascinating quantum insight! Some interpretations suggest conscious observation collapses quantum wave functions, making consciousness fundamental to physical reality rather than emergent from it. This would reverse the usual materialism.",
            incorrect_feedback: "The measurement problem is real, and some interpretations do assign consciousness a fundamental role in quantum mechanics. If consciousness helps determine physical reality, it can't be merely emergent from physical processes.",

            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent neuroscientific insight! Split-brain patients seem to have divided consciousness streams, suggesting consciousness depends on brain connectivity. This supports consciousness as emergent from neural architecture rather than fundamental unity.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Split-brain studies do suggest consciousness can be divided, which challenges ideas of consciousness as a unified, indivisible entity. The dependency on brain structures supports naturalistic explanations.",

            correct_answer: false,
            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Thoughtful but consider patterns! Personal identity might persist through pattern continuity rather than material persistence. Like a river maintaining identity despite constantly changing water, consciousness might be about information patterns rather than specific matter.",
            incorrect_feedback: "Personal identity persistence is striking, but pattern continuity can explain this. The brain maintains functional patterns even as individual cells are replaced, preserving psychological continuity through informational rather than material persistence.",

            correct_answer: true,
            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent neurological knowledge! The default mode network is indeed active during self-referential thinking and introspection. Finding specific neural correlates of consciousness supports the view that awareness emerges from brain activity.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While neural correlates are important, correlation doesn't prove causation. The default mode network might facilitate consciousness rather than generate it, like a radio receiving signals rather than creating them.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Profound insight into consciousness's unique nature! The fundamental privacy of subjective experience is unlike anything else in physical reality. This irreducible subjectivity might indicate consciousness operates by principles beyond ordinary physical causation.",
            incorrect_feedback: "The privacy of consciousness is indeed unique in physical reality. While everything else can theoretically be observed or measured, subjective experience remains fundamentally private, suggesting special ontological status.",

            value: 15,
            correct_feedback: "Insightful but incomplete! Psychedelics do alter consciousness by changing brain chemistry, but this could mean brain chemistry modulates rather than creates consciousness. Like adjusting a radio doesn't prove the radio creates the signal it receives.",
            incorrect_feedback: "While psychedelics clearly affect consciousness through brain chemistry, this might indicate that chemistry modulates or filters consciousness rather than generating it. The relationship could be more complex than simple production.",

            value: 20,
            correct_feedback: "Brilliant philosophical insight! If reality is fundamentally mathematical, and mathematics is inherently mental, this suggests mind-like properties are basic to existence rather than emergent accidents. The universe might be more mind-like than matter-like at its foundation.",
            incorrect_feedback: "The mathematical nature of reality does raise deep questions. If the universe operates by mathematical principles, and mathematics seems to require mind-like understanding, perhaps consciousness is more fundamental than usually assumed.",

            value: 10,
            correct_feedback: "Excellent clinical observation! Anesthesia can indeed eliminate consciousness while maintaining vital functions, suggesting consciousness is a specific brain process rather than fundamental to all neural activity. This supports consciousness as emergent rather than basic.",

            correct_feedback: "Sophisticated philosophical analysis! The combination problem is real but might be solvable. Just as individual notes combine into melodies through harmonic relationships, micro-experiences might combine through informational or temporal relationships we don't yet understand.",

Mirror self-recognition, theory of mind, and abstract thinking emerge as specific brain regions develop, supporting consciousness as brain-dependent.",
